<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

pandas is an open-source tool built on top of Python to make data cleaning and analysis fast and efficient. pandas leverages NumPy functionalities such as array-based computing, in particular array-based functions and a preference for data processing without `for` loops. The core difference between Numpy and pandas is that Numpy is developed for working with homogeneous numerical array data and pandas is best suited for working with tabular or heterogeneous data.

This tutorial will discuss core pandas functionalities, including:
- Creating pandas Series and DataFrame;
- Manipulating pandas objects (e.g., reindexing, modifying, and deleting index);
- Selecting data with loc and iloc;
- Sorting and ranking data; and
- Computing descriptive statistics.
